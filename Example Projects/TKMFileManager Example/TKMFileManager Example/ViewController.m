	NSString *exampleFilePath = [manager findAndGetFile:@"example.txt"];
	
	//Now that we've found the example file, lets move it over to a new location. Since we're moving a file and not a directory, the directory its located in remains in tact. Note that we are also creating a new directory by doing this

	 * SECTION 3: The Adanced Stuff

	//We don't really need that file anymore, lets get rid of it.

	[manager deleteDirectory:[manager.documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"ExampleTextFile"]];
	[manager deleteDirectory:[manager.documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"ExampleTextFile2"]];
	
	//Now that we've cleaned all that up, lets copy 'example2.txt'. Wait, where is it? Documents or Main Bundle? Luckily, we can find and copy in one step too!
	[manager findAndCopyFile:@"example2.txt" toDirectory:manager.documentsDirectory];
	
	
	/*
	 * SECTION 4: The Outroduction
	 */
	// That's All Folks! Now you're and expert with managing files with TKMFileManager.
	// Not all of the available methods were shown off here, but this should be enough for you to understand how this thing works.
	// More methods are being added, but for now, you should be able to perform any operation you may need with a combination of operations here
		//For example, you'll notice there isn't a 'renameDirectory' in this version. To be perfectly honest, I forgot to write it, but it will be in the next version. For now, here's how you can rename a directory using the avaible functions:
			//[manager createDirectory:@"PathOfTheNameYouWantToGiveTheDirectoryYouAreRenaming"];
			//[manager moveDirectory:@"PathOfDirectoryToRename" toDirectory:@"PathOfTheNameYouWantToGiveTheDirectoryYouAreRenaming"];
		//That's it! Its exactly the same as renaming a directory.
		//Renaming directories will be available in the next version, so hold tight!
	//If you have an operation you'd like to be added, you can contact me on Twitter: @TheTomMetzger, or you can email me: tom@southernerd.us
	//Thanks for using TKMFileManager! Happy Managing!
