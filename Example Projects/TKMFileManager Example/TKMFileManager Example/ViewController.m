	// That's All Folks! Now you're and expert with managing files with TKMFileManager.
	// Not all of the available methods were shown off here, but this should be enough for you to understand how this thing works.
	// More methods are being added, but for now, you should be able to perform any operation you may need with a combination of operations here
	//If you have an operation you'd like to be added, you can contact me on Twitter: @TheTomMetzger, or you can email me: tom@southernerd.us
	//Thanks for using TKMFileManager! Happy Managing!
